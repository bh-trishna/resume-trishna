                    I am a pre-final year B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering student at Dr. B.C. Roy Engineering College, Durgapur, with a strong foundation in programming, data structures and algorithms (DSA), and software development. Passionate about emerging technologies, I have a keen interest in DSA and web development. My academic projects reflect my skills in coding, problem-solving, and teamwork. I am eager to apply my technical knowledge in real-world projects and look forward to gaining hands-on experience through internships and collaborative opportunities.

                    <h3>Library Management System</h3>
                    <p>Developed a console-based Library Management System in C to manage book records and track borrow/return status for students and faculty. Implemented features for adding, deleting, and searching books, as well as updating book availability status, using file handling for data storage.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Weather Data Analyzer </h3>
                    <p>Created a Python program that analyzes and visualizes weather data from a CSV file, using libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib. The program processes data to display trends, averages, and comparisons across different timeframes, providing meaningful insights into weather patterns.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Student Attendance Tracker </h3>
                    <p>Developed a Java-based Student Attendance Tracker with a graphical user interface (GUI) to manage and record student attendance. The application allows teachers to mark daily attendance, view attendance reports, and calculate attendance percentages for each student, leveraging Java's Swing library for the interface.</p>
